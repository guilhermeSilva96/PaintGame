In this repository you will find a simple Paint Game, made in Java with the use of an external library called SimpleGraphics.

The commands are:
 - W,A,S,D for movement.
 - Space to Paint or Delete.
 - C will delete all the painted cells.
 - F will save to a file the current state of the game.
 - L will load from that file the last save commited.
